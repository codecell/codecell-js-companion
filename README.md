jscop foldername # To lint all *.js files a specific folder.
```

## ERRORS that can currently be detected include

### VARIABLE NAMING ERRORS
  - if capital letters or numbers is used to start a variable name, e.g
    - `*Bad practice* let 8owngoal = 4 or const Capvar = 9`
    - `*Good Practice* let meka = 4 or const mEeka = 9`
    
### CLASS NAME ERRORS 
  - if class names begin With small letters and/or
  - if class names is Snake-Cased or both e.g
    - `*Bad practice* class badclass {} or class Bad-class {}`    
    - `*Good Practice* class GoodClass {} or class Good_Class {}`
    
### SPACING ERRORS
  - if Spaces are found at beginning of lines
  - if extra spaces are found around variables e.g
    - `*Bad practice* let|   | vacuuuum = 4 or var hollow|    | = 9`
    - `*Good Practice* let meka = 4 or const mEeka = 9`

### CLASS COUNT ERROR
  - if more than one class is defined in a Module,

### UNUSED VARIABLE ERROR
  - if a variable (var, let, const) is defined and never used.
  - A lot of edge cases is covered here.

## Arguments Supported By Js-Companion to check Javascript code
  - You can pass in file(s) or a folder in any of the following cases in your terminal
    - `Youn can pass in a specific file Path to test just the file`
    - `You can pass in a Folder and all Javascript files in it will be checked and finally`
    - `Everything Js can be linted all at once (both files and Folders)`

## Testing This Repo
## Unit Tests
- Ensure you have `rspec` installed, or ensure the `gem 'rspec` is listed among the gems in the `Gemfile` => then run `bundle install`
- in your console, run `rspec` or `rake` to run all the unit tests written for this project

## Built With
- Ruby
- [Rubular](https://rubular.com/) Was used to craft and test the regular expressions
- Rubocop Linter
- Stickler CI
